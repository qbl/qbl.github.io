Recently, by recommendation from a friend, I read Dan Ariely's book titled "Predictably Irrational". I still have four more chapters to finish it, but there is one particular point that I want discuss from the book.

In a chapter titled "The Effect of Expectation", Ariely writes about an experiment he conducted with several of his colleagues to test how expectation affects our experience. In the experiment, Ariely went to a college bar frequente by MIT students and gave the students two glasses of beer.

Outline:
- The effect of expectation
- What to look for in a watch
- Sidu's speech on algorithm vs rigor software engineering
- What to look for in a software engineer?
- What to look for in other aspects of our lives such as leaders, products, etc
