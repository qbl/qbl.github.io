Earlier today I was having a lunch with two friends at a nice cafe in Indiranagar. One works in the same place as I work, the other works in a different place. All the three of us work as a software engineer.

We discuss a lot of things. One of them being my travel plan for the next two months. My team has committed to spend a straight six weeks working together in the same place: two weeks in Bangalore, followed by two weeks in Jakarta, and then another two weeks in Bangalore again. That means I will travel to Bangaolre twice for the next two months while the folks from Bangalore office have to travel to Jakarta as well.

The friend who works for a different company raises


Points:
- Travel Plan
- Pairing vs Remote Working
- Bus Factor, Eichiro Oda
- All Valids
- Politics?
