4. The first and most important purpose that a mentor serves is that of a role model. It’s hard to know what’s possible until you see someone who can stretch the limits you’re familiar with. A role model sets the standard for what “good” means. If you thought of yourself as a chess player, for example, just being able to beat the people in your immediate family might feel pretty good. But, if you played with a tournament player, you would find that chess is a much deeper game than you ever knew. If you were to play with a grand master, you’d have another such revelation. If you keep playing with, and beating, your immediate family members, you might get the idea that you’re really good at chess. Without a role model, there’s no incentive to get better.
