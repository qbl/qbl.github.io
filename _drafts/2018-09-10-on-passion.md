I am not really sure if I am for or against passion. In fact, these days, I am not really sure about much. I believe for the greater part of my career I do not do the things I do for passion. Most of the time it was either out of necessity or out of competition. 

The first time I got paid for writing things was when I became a contributor for a Singapore-based tech blog. The very reason I applied for that job was because at the time I was married and the company that I co-founded did not have an enough steady stream of revenue to support me. When I was single, that was fine. I could go on for months without pay. A bowl of Indomie a day kept my worries away.

Luckily for me, as the tech blog is quite popular, I was very aware that whatever I write will be read by someone.
